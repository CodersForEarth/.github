  <b>CREDITS</b>
</p>

Thank you `@realvjy` for designing this logo at
[illlustrations.co](https://illlustrations.co/)
and making it open-source.

Our project name *Coders for Earth* was added by using
a vector-graphics editor called
[Boxy SVG](https://boxy-svg.com/),
with *Bungee* 89pt and *Maven Pro*
52pt from Google Fonts.

We initially had a problem with our .svg files;
fonts would default back to the system font
on GitHub. However, we were able to fix this
issue by choosing the option `Convert texts to paths`
on BoxySVG on the export option.
