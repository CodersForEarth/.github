  <b>CREDITS</b>
</p>

We didn't have to design our logo ourselves,
thanks to `@realvjy`, who published the owl on
[illlustrations.co](https://illlustrations.co/)
and made it open-source. Thank you, `@realvjy`!

Plus, we added the text `CODERS FOR EARTH` with
Google Fonts `Bungee` 89pt, using a vector 
graphics editor [Boxy SVG](https://boxy-svg.com/).

We initially had a problem with our `.svg` file;
its font would default back to the system font
on `GitHub`. However, we were able to fix this 
issue by choosing the `Convert texts to paths` 
option on `BoxySVG` when exporting the image.
