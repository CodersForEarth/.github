  <b>CREDITS</b>
</p>

We didn't have to design our logo ourselves,
thanks to `@realvjy`, who published the owl on
[illlustrations.co](https://illlustrations.co/)
and made it open-source. Thank you, `@realvjy`!
Our project name `CODERS FOR EARTH` was added by using
a vector-graphics editor called 
[Boxy SVG](https://boxy-svg.com/),
with Google Fonts `Bungee` 89pt.
 
We initially had a problem with our `.svg` file;
its font would default back to the system font
on `GitHub`. However, we were able to fix this 
issue by choosing the option `Convert texts to paths` 
on `BoxySVG` when exporting the image.
