***Who are we?***<br>
College students. Internet strangers.
Open-source developers.

A lot of us actually
want to do meaningful work in our life instead
of just making apps that attract more ads.
Don't get me wrong. Making consumer products
is necessary, great, and novel, too, but it's
human nature to have a lifelong desire to
work on projects that truly matter to us
and make a meaningful difference in the world.

<br>

***Why did we make Nsustain?***<br>
The idea is that farmers are the people who work most
closely with the environment. Thus, solving any kind of
problem that farmers have is one of the best ways to make
a positive impact on environmental sustainability.
Most people who have office jobs simply don't
have close contact with problems related
to the environment and sustainability.
Farmers, in contrast, are possibly the
most-knowledgeable group. They know about
the biggest problems that need the greatest
solutions.

The same goes for scientists, environmentalists, or doctors.
Anyone who work closely with the environment.
Anyone who work on the frontline.
You see, this is a win-win situation. You get technological
support without spending any money. We get real-world,
exciting, fun problems to solve!

Our goal is to use our skills and expertise to make a positive
impact on the environment, while also providing valuable experience
and opportunities for our volunteers. We believe that by working
closely with those who have a deep understanding of the challenges
facing the environment, we can develop innovative solutions that
address these issues and make a lasting difference. We are committed
to running Nsustain for as long as we can, and we are honored to have
the opportunity to use our skills to make a positive impact on the world.

<br>

***What does Nsustain stand for?***<br>
E[<b>n</b>]vironment and
[<b>sustain</b>]ability.
Nsustain is a website where anyone working closely with
the environment such as farmers, environmentalists, or scientists
can come ask for help.
