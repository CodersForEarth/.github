***Who are we?***<br>
College students. Internet strangers.
Open-source developers.

A lot of us actually
want to do meaningful work in our life instead
of just making apps that attract more ads.
Don't get me wrong -- making apps for
ads money is manytimes great and novel too, but it's
human nature to have a lifelong desire
for meaningful work that truly matters in your life.

<br>

***Why did we create Nsustain?***<br>
The idea is that farmers are the people who work most
closely with the environment. Thus, solving any kind of
problem that farmers have is one of the best ways to make
a positive impact on environmental sustainability.

Most people who have office jobs don‚Äôt know what it's like
to work closely with the environment. Farmers, in contrast,
are possibly the most-knowledgeable group that knows very well
about the environment.

The same goes for scientists, environmentalists,
or anyone working closely with the environment.

You see, this is a win-win situation. Farmers get technological
support, while at the same time open-source developers get real-world,
exciting, fun problems to solve!

This is why we made this into a non-profit organization.
We‚Äôre planning on running this organization as long as
we can, hopefully our lifetime, because helping out farmers
genuinely makes us happy. We should thank them, too,
because the fulfilment we get by doing this is great
for us as well. We're honored to help you.

<br>

***What does Nsustain stand for?***<br>
E[<b>n</b>]vironment and
[<b>sustain</b>]ability.
Nsustain is a website where anyone working closely with
the environment such as farmers, environmentalists, or scientists
can come ask for help.
