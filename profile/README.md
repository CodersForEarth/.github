***Why did we make Nsustain?***<br>
The idea is that farmers and scientists are the people who work
most closely with the environment, so solving any
problems they have is likely one of the best ways
to make a positive impact on environmental sustainability.

<br>

***Who are we?***<br>
College students. Internet strangers.
Open-source developers.
We wanted to do something good for the environment and sustainability, but realized it's really hard to make a big impact as regular people like ourselves. So, we wanted to make a way for everyone to contribute. This is why we created a non-profit called Nsustain, which stands for E[<b>N</b>]vironment and [<b>sustain</b>]ability.
