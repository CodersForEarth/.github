## Coders For Earth

Our organization webpage will be updated in a few months :)

<!---
Note on how the logo was created:

The original image was created by @realvjy
Thank you again for open-sourcing it!

After downloading the base image from
https://illlustrations.co/
The base image was edited with `BoxySVG`.

This logo uses the font `Bungee` size 89.
Plus, the .svg file's font was not rednering
on GitHub correctly at first, but it was
fixed by choosing the "Convert texts to paths"
option on the export settings.


To Do:

- Add descriptions on the organization setting,
- Add explanation for the main gist
