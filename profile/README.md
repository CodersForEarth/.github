# Nsustain
> If your work is realated to environmental sustainability, we'll do our best to connect you with a techy person who can probably give you a solution using technology.
> Please make your request as specific as you can -- e.g. how do you want it to look like (draw it and attach it if you can) and who will be using it?

<br>

***Why did we make Nsustain?***<br>
The idea is that farmers, scientists, etc, are the people who work
most closely with the environment, so solving any
problems they have is likely one of the best ways
to make a positive impact on environmental sustainability.

<br>

***Who are we?***<br>
College students. Internet strangers.
Open-source developers.
We wanted to do something good for the environment and sustainability, but realized it's really hard to make a big impact as regular people like ourselves. So, we wanted to make a way for everyone to contribute. This is why we created a non-profit called Nsustain, which stands for E[<b>N</b>]vironment and [<b>sustain</b>]ability.

## Repositories

#### Nsustain Source Code [[GitHub](https://github.com/Nsustain/nsustain.com)]

Nsustain uses [Flarum](https://github.com/flarum) (a really cool forum framework) and other open-source projects.
Our goal is to be as self-sustainable as possible with little to no maintenance (although we know no maintenance might be nearly impossible).
This repository is how we run [Nsustain.com](https://nsustain.com)

<br>

#### Official Logos [[GitHub](https://github.com/Nsustain/.github)]

We have various versions of our official
logos maintained at this repository.
Each version is stored as `.png` and
`.svg` files.
