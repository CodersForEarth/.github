    About<br>
    [<a href="https://nsustain.com">Official Website</a>]
  </b>
  <br>
  <br>
  ðŸŒ³ Nsustain is about connecting people who need our help with those who can help. A website where volunteer open-source developers can come help farmers and scientists around the world.
</p>

<br>
<br>

***Who are we?***<br>
We are a bunch of
open-source developers
who were trying to do something good
for the environment and sustainability.
Since there are so many environmental problems,
we wanted to help in any way we can, but we couldn't.
That was the problem.

<br>

***Why did we create Nsustain?***<br>
In order to help solve environmental problems,
we need somebody that works closely with the
environment to keep working with us not only to
show us what and where the problem is on the first place,
but also to tell us if our solution actually worked or not.
It's hard for regular people like us to
meet people who can do this for us. Thus, we created Nsustain.

<br>

***What does Nsustain mean?***<br>
E[<b>n</b>]vironment and
[<b>sustain</b>]ability.
Nsustain is a website where anyone working closely with
the environment such as farmers, environmentalists, or scientists
can come ask for help in solving the environmental problems
they had encountered while working closely with the environment.
