***Who are we?***<br>
We are a bunch of
open-source developers
who were trying to do something good
for the environment and sustainability.
We knew there are a lot of problems
that need our help, but the problem was that
we didn't know where to find them.

<br>

***Why did we create Nsustain?***<br>
We made what we needed, and that is Nsustain,
an open-source community where
anyone who works closely with the environment
such as farmers, environmentalists, or scientists
can communicate with open-source developers
who are willing to help out for
the environment and sustainability.

<br>

***What does Nsustain mean?***<br>
E[<b>n</b>]vironment and
[<b>sustain</b>]ability.
