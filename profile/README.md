***Who are we?***<br>
College students. Internet strangers.
Open-source developers.

We are the kind of people who were tired
of writing code that merely tries
to attract more ads money. We needed to take
a break and wanted to work on projects that
we truly care about.

<br>

***Why did we make Nsustain?***<br>
The idea is that farmers are the people who work
most closely with the environment, so solving any
problems they have is likely one of the best ways
to make a positive impact on environmental sustainability.
People who have office jobs often
do not have close contact with environmental issues
or sustainability problems.
By working with these individuals,
who have a deep understanding of the challenges facing the
environment, Nsustain hopes to develop innovative solutions
that make a lasting positive impact.

Nsustain is a platform designed to help regular people make a
direct impact on environmental sustainability. We aim to empower
individuals to take action and contribute to the fight against climate change.
We are committed to running Nsustain for as long as we can,
hopefully our lifetime, and we are honored to
have the opportunity to use our skills
to make a positive impact on the world.

<br>

***What does Nsustain stand for?***<br>
E[<b>N</b>]vironment and [<b>sustain</b>]ability.
**Nsustain**.
