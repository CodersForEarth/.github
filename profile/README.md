***Who are we?***<br>
College students. Internet strangers.
Open-source developers.

We want to work on projects that have a purpose
and make a positive impact, rather than simply
creating apps that generate revenue through
advertising. While there is value in developing
consumer products, we also recognize everyone
has the desire to work on projects that truly matter.
Projects that we truly care about.

<br>

***Why did we make Nsustain?***<br>
The idea is that farmers are the people who work most
closely with the environment. Thus, solving any kind of
problem that farmers have is one of the best ways to make
a positive impact on environmental sustainability.
Most people who have office jobs simply don't
have close contact with problems related
to the environment and sustainability.
Farmers, in contrast, are possibly the
most-knowledgeable group. By working with these individuals,
who have a deep understanding of the challenges facing the
environment, Nsustain hopes to develop innovative solutions
that make a lasting positive impact.

Nsustain is a platform designed to help regular people make a
direct impact on environmental sustainability. We aim to empower
individuals to take action and contribute to the fight against climate change.
We are committed to running Nsustain for as long as we can, and
we are honored to have the opportunity to use our skills
to make a positive impact on the world.

<br>

***What does Nsustain stand for?***<br>
E[<b>N</b>]vironment and [<b>sustain</b>]ability.
**Nsustain**.
