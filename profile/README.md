## Repositories

#### Nsustain.com Source Code [[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Nsustain/nsustain.com)]

This repository contains all of our
website's source code. It also shows
exactly how we built our website.

<br>

#### Maintenance Page Source Code [[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Nsustain/maintenance-page)]

The maintenance page is used in the
unlikely event of software / hardware
failure in our main server. Our
maintenance page is designed such that
we can deploy it just by cloning
this repository and using `docker compose`
to load the official docker nginx image.
All our source code and how to use it
is documented on this repository's `README.MD`.

#### Official Logo [[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Nsustain/.github)]

We have various versions of our official
logo maintained at this repository.
Our owl, by the way, represents coders.
If you look at its claws, you can see
that it's typing.
