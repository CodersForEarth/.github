    [<a href="https://nsustain.com">Official Website</a>]

***Who are we?***<br>
We are a bunch of
open-source developers
who were trying to do something good
for the e[**n**]vironment & 
[**sustain**]ability.
We knew there are a lot of problems
that need our help, but the problem was that
we didn't know where to find them.

<br>

***Why did we create Nsustain?***<br>
So, we made exactly what we needed. Nsustain
is an open-source community where
anyone who works closely with the environment -
such as farmers, environmentalists, and scientists -
can communicate with open-source developers
who are willing to do good things for
the e[**n**]vironment & 
[**sustain**]ability.

<br>

***What does Nsustain mean?***<br>
An open-source community for the
e[<b>n</b>]vironment &
[<b>sustain</b>]ability.

<br>

***How do we keep maintaining our server?***<br>
We don't do ads.
Our website was created to be a
place for the open-source community.
As such, Nsustain
will always be an open-source website
and will never be commercialized,
since we genuinly want to do good things for
the e[**n**]vironment & [**sustain**]ability.
