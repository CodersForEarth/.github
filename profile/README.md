***Who are we?***<br>
We are a bunch of
open-source developers
who were trying to find
an idea we can work on in order to
help the envrionment,
an idea that touches our heart,
an idea that's worth our time and devotion,
but couldn't.

It was such a tragedy
that - although we wanted to help -
we couldn't find a specific problem
on sustainability. They certainly exist.
We all know that there are a lot of
environmental problems that need solutions.
It was just that we didn't know
where to find them.

<br>

***Why do we do what we do?***<br>
So, we made exactly what we
wanted and needed. Nsustain
is an open-source community, where
front-line environmental workers -
e.g. farmers and scientists - can
post specific problems they've noticed
in the world. Coders looking for
a meaningful project that's really worth it
now has one.

The goal of our website is to help
you find a project that really touches
your heart, something that you truly find worthwhile.
We will always try to make that process
as smooth and enjoyable as possible for you.

At the same time, we don't do anything sneaky.
Security is our top-most priority, and
we aren't interested in any of your personal information.
We don't store suspicious cookies tracking everything you do.
We don't optimize our website such that you
stay on our website as long as possible.
No, we don't want you to spend all day on Nsustain.
Go help the environment. Write codes.
Whatever you think is the best for the
e[**n**]vironment & [***sustain***]ability.

<br>

***What does Nsustain mean?***<br>
An open-source community for the
e[<b>n</b>]vironment &
[<b>sustain</b>]ability.

<br>

***How do we keep maintaining our server?***<br>
We don't do ads.
Our website was created to be a
place for the open-source community.
As such, Nsustain
will always be an open-source project,
and we will never commercialize our website.
We do this because we genuinly wanted
to help make the e[**n**]vironment [**sustain**]able.

<!--
***How did this all begin?***<br>
Soobin Rho and Mariam Wisaal started
this project for
*2022 Call for Code Global Challenge*,
which was an environmental initiative
inviting "developers and problem solvers
around the world to build and contribute
to sustainable open source technology projects."
Soobin and Mariam were college sophomores
at Augustana University at that time,
and the challenge was held for six months
from May, 2022 to October, 2022.
