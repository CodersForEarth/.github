## Repositories

**CodersForEarth.com Source Code [[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/CodersForEarth/codersforearth.com)]**

This repository contains all of our
website's source code. It also shows
exactly how we built our website.

<br>

**Maintenance Page Source Code [[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/CodersForEarth/maintenance-page)]**

The maintenance page is used in the
unlikely event of software / hardware
failure in our main server. Our
maintenance page is designed such that
we can deploy it just by cloning
this repository and using `docker-compose`
to load the official docker nginx image.
All our source code and how to use it
is documented on this repository's `README.MD`.

<br>

**Official Logo [[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/CodersForEarth/.github)]**

We have various versions of our official
logo maintained at this repository.
Our owl, by the way, represents coders.
If you look at its claws, you can see
that it's typing.
