**July 8, 2022** We haven't yet finished
our website, so our website is not online
obviously, but we wrote this page
in the past tense to document the process.
Anyway, please come back in a few months!
This project will remain in the development
phase until at least the end of October.

Why we are working so hard on
this website. Why we believe in this,
and why we believe this will help you, too.

  <b>HOW OUR WEBSITE WAS MADE</b>
</p>

Here are the exact steps we took to
make [our website](https://codersforearth.com).
We documented each step from ground-up,
hoping that you can replicate it 
relatively easily if you need to. 

...

## 1. Designing the web
`git`
`GitHub`

Create a `GitHub` repository because
version control ...



`javascript`
`react.js`
`next.js`

Create the website.

...

#### Building the website's database
`SQLite`
`IBM Databases for etcd`

...

## 2. Web Server
`nginx` <br>
[[Original article by Joe Morgan](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-deploy-a-react-application-with-nginx-on-ubuntu-20-04)]

...

## 3. Containerization
`Docker`

Make our website into a `Docket` image.
Why containerize and why not else.

## 4. Virtual Private Server
`DigitalOcean`
`Ubuntu Server`

Get a VPS. Around $6 per month.

## 5. Container Orchestration System
`Kubernetes`
`K3s`

Explanation on high availability.
Why `K3s` and not else, showing
the how and why behind 
our design & architecture choices.

Install `K3s`.

Configure the `K3s` to pull our website
in the form of a `Docker` image.

Note: The reason why we use `Kubernetes`.
When our website gains more popularity,
server capability can be upscaled by
getting another VPS and then adding it
on our `K3s` as a worker node.

Even when we deploy a new node or when
we update our website, our website never
goes offline thanks to `Kubernetes`.

You could go to 
[our website](https://codersforearth.com)
and see if there's any project
you'd love to invest your time in,
or you could even become a contributor
of this website itself. 
Our website is open-source.

Plus, you could download various
versions of our logo
